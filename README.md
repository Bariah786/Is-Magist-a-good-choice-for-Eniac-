# Eniac Brazil Expansion Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of Magist's database to support Eniac's decision-making process regarding its potential expansion into the Brazilian market. Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories and is considering partnering with Magist, a Brazilian Software as a Service (SaaS) company, to facilitate its market entry.

The goal of this project is to address the following concerns:
- Is Magist a good partner for Eniac's high-end tech products?
- Are the delivery times offered by Magist (via the public Post Office) fast enough to meet Eniac's standards?

### Problem Statement

Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist to help expand into Brazil. However, there are concerns regarding:
- **Product Compatibility**: Eniac's products are specialized, high-end Apple-compatible accessories. It’s important to understand if Magist is a suitable partner to handle such products.
- **Delivery Times**: Eniac's customers expect fast deliveries. The delivery process handled by Magist may involve public Post Office services, which might be slow. We need to assess whether these delivery times are acceptable.

### Approach

We have access to a snapshot of Magist's database to answer these concerns. This dataset provides valuable information on:
- Shipment details (delivery time, etc.)
- Inventory and order management
- Customer feedback and service ratings

### Key Tasks

1. **Data Exploration**: Examine Magist’s dataset to evaluate the performance of the existing supply chain, focusing on delivery times and compatibility with Eniac’s product range.
2. **Data Analysis**: Identify patterns and trends in delivery times, customer satisfaction, and potential issues with product compatibility.
3. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights for Eniac’s management on whether to proceed with Magist, adjust delivery strategies, or explore alternative partnerships.

### Data

The dataset provided by Magist includes:
- Order details (product types, quantities, delivery times)
- Customer feedback (ratings and complaints)
- Shipping details (delivery costs, methods)

### Tools Used

- **SQL**: For querying and exploring the dataset.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing the data and providing insights.
- **Canva**: For preparing presentation.
